# MindForum

Shared AI brainstorming room app for small faculty groups. Next.js 15 + SSE + Postgres.

## Key paths

| | |
|---|---|
| Prod URL | (private — see `~/.claude/projects/-Users-vishal-research-mindforum/memory/`) |
| VPS path | `/root/repos/mindforum` (ssh alias `vps`) |
| Process | PM2 id `mindforum`, port 3006 |
| Database | Postgres: role `mindforum`, db `mindforum`, localhost:5432 |
| Repo | `gies-ai-experiments/MindForum` (public, MIT; deploy key `mindforum_deploy` on VPS) |

## Required env vars

`OPENAI_API_KEY` · `POSTGRES_URL` · `ADMIN_TOKEN` (for `/api/admin/seed`) · optional `OPENAI_MODEL` (default `gpt-5.4`).

## Deploy recipe

Push locally, then on VPS:

```bash
cd /root/repos/mindforum
git checkout -- package-lock.json    # npm install dirties this; clean before pull
git pull
npm install
npm run migrate                       # if db/schema.sql changed
npm run build
pm2 restart mindforum --update-env    # --update-env re-reads .env.local
```

See `~/.claude/references/vps-deployment.md` for shared-VPS gotchas (deploy keys, port binding, nginx).

## Reseeding a room at a specific ID

After a restart wipes process memory (pre-Postgres behavior) or when preloading a canonical room setup, use the admin seed endpoint. Script template at `/tmp/seed-mindforum-room.py` from the initial setup — scp to VPS and run. Canonical room for the 01-sequence AI ethics exercise is `-xM9Qgfk4g` (config in `rooms/2026-04-20-ai-ethics-exercise-design/`).

## Rate limits (per-IP, in-memory)

`POST /api/room` 5/10min · `join` 10/min · `message` 60/min · `upload` 10/10min · `brief` 3/5min. Reset on process restart — by design.

## Architecture gotchas

- **`next start` doesn't read PORT from `.env.local`** — must be in shell env at `pm2 start` time. Already baked in; don't touch unless rebuilding the PM2 entry.
- **Admin seed `replaceMode: "metadata"` (default) preserves chat history**; `"full"` wipes the whole room. Matters for `/api/admin/seed` callers.
- **AI reply streaming flushes to Postgres every ~1s** during generation, plus a final flush. A mid-stream process crash loses only the unflushed tail; reconnecting clients see the last flushed state, never permanently-empty bubbles.

## Room configs

Per-room setup artifacts live under `rooms/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/`:
- `README.md` — room setup checklist
- `facilitator-system-prompt.md` — AI guidance to paste at room creation
- other supporting files (source transcripts, draft prompts, etc.) — uploaded to the room

## Current Focus

Set OpenAI monthly spend cap on the dedicated MindForum key (defense-in-depth #2). Monitor early MSBAi engagement and the new `ai-ready-illinois-scoping` faculty room; tail `/var/log/mindforum-refresh.log` for cron health. Operate live rooms via the `/admin/rooms` dashboard. File-content preview UX assigned to student collaborator via [issue #5](https://github.com/gies-ai-experiments/MindForum/issues/5).

## Roadmap

- [x] MVP from Ash's spec
- [x] Deploy to VPS behind nginx + Cloudflare
- [x] Token-streamed `@ai` replies
- [x] Per-room system prompt + file upload
- [x] Project brief with `↓ Download .md`
- [x] Admin seed endpoint (URL-stable rooms)
- [x] Per-IP rate limiter
- [x] Postgres persistence (chat history survives restarts)
- [x] Repo flipped public + MIT LICENSE + topics; `rooms/` stripped from history
- [x] `POST /api/room` gated behind `ADMIN_TOKEN` (defense-in-depth for public repo)
- [x] Hybrid Builder article drafted, trimmed, RSA-Animate cover images generated (v1 picked)
- [x] Substack + LinkedIn drafts loaded; X thread composed in modal
- [x] Final publish on Substack + LinkedIn + X (live 2026-04-25)
- [x] GPM stakeholder brainstorm room (`gpm-brainstorm`) seeded with Marketplace Co-pilot prompt + proposal file uploaded
- [x] MSBAi stakeholder rooms seeded (`msbai-pilot-faculty` 22 files, `msbai-corporate-partners` 8 files); daily KB refresh via `rooms/refresh-msbai-kb.sh` cron at 06:00 UTC; system prompts auto-stamp `last refresh` date
- [x] Render `@ai` replies as markdown (react-markdown + remark-gfm); human messages keep existing renderer
- [x] Catch-up modal now blocks "Got it" until summary lands (prevents fast-clickers dismissing before bullets render)
- [x] Send MSBAi room invitations (faculty/staff list + corporate partners individually) — sent 2026-04-27
- [x] Admin rooms dashboard `/admin/rooms` (sortable activity table, name filter, copy-link, cookie auth via existing `ADMIN_TOKEN`) — shipped 2026-04-28, [PR #6](https://github.com/gies-ai-experiments/MindForum/pull/6)
- [ ] Set OpenAI monthly spend cap on the dedicated MindForum key (defense-in-depth #2)
- [ ] Send faculty invitation for room `-xM9Qgfk4g`
- [ ] Collect feedback from first facilitated session; iterate on prompts
- [ ] **2026-05-25 review:** four weeks after MSBAi rooms launch — check usage signal (faculty engagement vs lurking) to decide whether to keep brainstorm framing or convert to a K-ai-activity-mirror digest (see `.claude/plans/file-content-preview-ux.md` for the broader UX direction)
- [ ] File-content preview UX (modal with markdown render) — issue [#5](https://github.com/gies-ai-experiments/MindForum/issues/5), spec in `docs/feature-requests/file-content-preview.md`, owned by student collaborator

## Session Log

### 2026-04-28
- Completed: (1) Fixed first-visit orientation modal in `/room/[id]` ([commit 17b5333](https://github.com/gies-ai-experiments/MindForum/commit/17b5333)) — was dumping the raw `systemPrompt` with no scrollbar; removed `systemPrompt` from orientation payload and added `maxHeight: 85vh` + `overflowY: auto` defense-in-depth. (2) Seeded new faculty scoping room `ai-ready-illinois-scoping` for ~20 UIUC faculty discussing the AI-Ready Illinois Coordination Hub NSF proposal; system prompt emphasizes that scope is flexible and participants are not yet committed (config in `rooms/2026-04-28-ai-ready-illinois/`).
- Next: Set OpenAI monthly spend cap on the MindForum key. Tail `/var/log/mindforum-refresh.log` to confirm the MSBAi KB refresh cron is running cleanly. Upload AI-Ready Illinois deck + Google doc to the new room and share with faculty list.
