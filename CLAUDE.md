# MindForum

Shared AI brainstorming room app for small faculty groups. Next.js 15 + SSE + Postgres.

## Key paths

| | |
|---|---|
| Prod URL | (private — see `~/.claude/projects/-Users-vishal-research-mindforum/memory/`) |
| VPS path | `/root/repos/mindforum` (ssh alias `vps`) |
| Process | PM2 id `mindforum`, port 3006 |
| Database | Postgres: role `mindforum`, db `mindforum`, localhost:5432 |
| Repo | `gies-ai-experiments/MindForum` (private; deploy key `mindforum_deploy` on VPS) |

## Required env vars

`OPENAI_API_KEY` · `POSTGRES_URL` · `ADMIN_TOKEN` (for `/api/admin/seed`) · optional `OPENAI_MODEL` (default `gpt-5.4`).

## Deploy recipe

Push locally, then on VPS:

```bash
cd /root/repos/mindforum
git checkout -- package-lock.json    # npm install dirties this; clean before pull
git pull
npm install
npm run migrate                       # if db/schema.sql changed
npm run build
pm2 restart mindforum --update-env    # --update-env re-reads .env.local
```

See `~/.claude/references/vps-deployment.md` for shared-VPS gotchas (deploy keys, port binding, nginx).

## Reseeding a room at a specific ID

After a restart wipes process memory (pre-Postgres behavior) or when preloading a canonical room setup, use the admin seed endpoint. Script template at `/tmp/seed-mindforum-room.py` from the initial setup — scp to VPS and run. Canonical room for the 01-sequence AI ethics exercise is `-xM9Qgfk4g` (config in `rooms/2026-04-20-ai-ethics-exercise-design/`).

## Rate limits (per-IP, in-memory)

`POST /api/room` 5/10min · `join` 10/min · `message` 60/min · `upload` 10/10min · `brief` 3/5min. Reset on process restart — by design.

## Architecture gotchas

- **`next start` doesn't read PORT from `.env.local`** — must be in shell env at `pm2 start` time. Already baked in; don't touch unless rebuilding the PM2 entry.
- **Admin seed `replaceMode: "metadata"` (default) preserves chat history**; `"full"` wipes the whole room. Matters for `/api/admin/seed` callers.
- **AI reply streaming flushes to Postgres every ~1s** during generation, plus a final flush. A mid-stream process crash loses only the unflushed tail; reconnecting clients see the last flushed state, never permanently-empty bubbles.

## Room configs

Per-room setup artifacts live under `rooms/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/`:
- `README.md` — room setup checklist
- `facilitator-system-prompt.md` — AI guidance to paste at room creation
- other supporting files (source transcripts, draft prompts, etc.) — uploaded to the room

## Current Focus

Publish the Hybrid Builder article about this build, then send the faculty invitation email for the 01-sequence AI ethics brainstorm.

## Roadmap

- [x] MVP from Ash's spec
- [x] Deploy to VPS behind nginx + Cloudflare
- [x] Token-streamed `@ai` replies
- [x] Per-room system prompt + file upload
- [x] Project brief with `↓ Download .md`
- [x] Admin seed endpoint (URL-stable rooms)
- [x] Per-IP rate limiter
- [x] Postgres persistence (chat history survives restarts)
- [ ] Publish Hybrid Builder article (draft stashed)
- [ ] Send faculty invitation for room `-xM9Qgfk4g`
- [ ] Collect feedback from first facilitated session; iterate on prompts

## Session Log

### 2026-04-21
- Completed: Built MVP end-to-end from Ash's spec (9d706fb → d099a80). Deployed on VPS with PM2 + nginx + Cloudflare null worker route. Added room config for the 01-sequence AI ethics brainstorm, including Willie's transcript + his draft student-facing prompt. Added `/api/admin/seed` for URL-stable rooms. Shipped per-IP rate limits. Migrated from in-memory Map to Postgres via `db/schema.sql` + `scripts/migrate.mjs` (Codex-reviewed). Drafted Hybrid Builder article (stashed WIP, not yet published).
- Next: Unstash and finish the article (link verification, editorial review, HTML, cover images, publish). Then send the faculty invitation email for `/room/-xM9Qgfk4g`.
